How did viewing a diff from two versions help spot a bug?

Well, it made it a lot easier to spot differences. not cumbersome. Let the PC do the hard work. save my eyesight.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

can easily spot mistakes and learn from them. spend more time programming instead of rooting through differences. can try out new ideas and if they dont work then revert back to a previous version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros:
Can commit at logical intervals

cons:
can forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because git is built for coding and some projects require multiple files to work

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gets the total history of commits for a repository
git diff checks the difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Well, you know you can always revert and fix the errors. It gives confidence to try something new as you cant break anything really.
