When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Maybe when multiple people are working on a single file and you want to push it to everyone

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

the remote repoitory might be a full production version and you dont want people to see changes yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork - a copy between two repositories on github. CLone - a copy from github to local. Branches - split a repository
